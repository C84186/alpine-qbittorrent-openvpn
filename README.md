# [üêã Alpine qBittorrent OpenVPN](https://github.com/guillaumedsde/alpine-qbittorrent-openvpn)

[![Gitlab pipeline status](https://img.shields.io/gitlab/pipeline/guillaumedsde/alpine-qbittorrent-openvpn)](https://gitlab.com/guillaumedsde/alpine-qbittorrent-openvpn/-/pipelines)
[![Docker Image Size (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/docker/image-size/guillaumedsde/alpine-qbittorrent-openvpn)](https://hub.docker.com/r/guillaumedsde/alpine-qbittorrent-openvpn)

This repository contains the code to build a docker container with the [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) torrent client with all traffic routed through an OpenVPN tunnel with firewall rules preventing traffic outside of the tunnel.
The container is built automatically whenever the Alpine container is updated, the final image is available on the [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/guillaumedsde/alpine-qbittorrent-openvpn).

This container is based on an [Alpine Linux](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine) and uses the [S6-overlay](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay) for starting setting up the firewall, VPN tunnel and lastly starting qBittorrent.
The image aims to be safe, small and generally minimal by installing as little dependencies as possible and running qBittorrent as an unprivileged user (soon the OpenVPN client).

## üèÅ How to Run

### `docker run`

```bash
$ docker run --cap-add=NET_ADMIN -d \
              -v /your/storage/path/:/downloads \
              -v /path/to/config/directory:/config \
              -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
              -e OPENVPN_PROVIDER=PIA \
              -e OPENVPN_CONFIG=CA\ Toronto \
              -e OPENVPN_USERNAME=user \
              -e OPENVPN_PASSWORD=pass \
              -e PUID=1000 \
              -e PGID=1000 \
              -e LAN=192.168.0.0/16 \
              -p 8080:8080 \
              guillaumedsde/alpine-qbittorrent-openvpn:latest
```

### `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
version: "3.3"
services:
  alpine-qbittorrent-openvpn:
    volumes:
      - "/your/storage/path/:/downloads"
      - "/path/to/config/directory:/config"
      - "/etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro"
    environment:
      - OPENVPN_PROVIDER=PIA
      - OPENVPN_CONFIG=CA\
      - OPENVPN_USERNAME=user
      - OPENVPN_PASSWORD=pass
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - LAN=192.168.0.0/16
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    image: guillaumedsde/alpine-qbittorrent-openvpn:latest
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Supported platforms

This container is built for many hardware platforms (yes, even ppc64le whoever uses that... üòâ):

- linux/386
- linux/amd64
- linux/arm/v6
- linux/arm/v7
- linux/arm64
- linux/ppc64le

All you have to do is use a recent version of docker and it will pull the appropriate image

## üöá OpenVPN configuration

### Officially supported

This image makes use of the [VPN providers'](https://haugene.github.io/docker-transmission-openvpn/supported-providers/) OpenVPN configurations from the latest version of [haugene/docker-transmission-openvpn](https://github.com/haugene/docker-transmission-openvpn/) cheers to that project üç∫!
It is possible I might have messed something up, so if one provider is not working for you, make sure to [leave an issue](https://github.com/guillaumedsde/alpine-qbittorrent-openvpn/issues/new/choose) on this repository's Github page.
Selecting a preloaded configuration works the same way as the haugene container (see below for an example).

### Custom OpenVPN config

If your provider is not in the supported list, you can mount your `.ovpn` file at `/config/openvpn/config.ovpn` optionally set your `OPENVPN_USERNAME` and `OPENVPN_PASSWORD` leaving the `OPENVPN_PROVIDER` empty and the container will load your configuration upon start.

## üêå Limitations

This image has a couple of limitations:

- **No IPv6 support** I have not installed iptables for IPv6 as such the firewall kill switch will probably not work with IPv6 (I have not tested it) if you need it, [file an issue](https://github.com/guillaumedsde/alpine-qbittorrent-openvpn/issues/new/choose) and I'll look into it when I have some time
- **DNS Leak** the firewall rules allow VPN traffic outside of the VPN tunnel, this is initally needed to resolve the hostname for the VPN host from the configuration, I am working on a fix that will prevent non-tunneled DNS traffic once the VPN tunnel is started
- **Healthcheck and automatic restarts** I am looking into this to make the container more resilient

## üôè Credits

A couple of projects really helped me out while developing this container:

- [0x022b/s6-openvpn](https://github.com/0x022b/s6-openvpn) for figuring out how the S6 overlay works
- [haugene/docker-transmission-openvpn](https://github.com/haugene/docker-transmission-openvpn) for general inspiration for the project and specifically, the OpenVPN configurations
